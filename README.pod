AnyEvent::Examples

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is inteded to become a collection of code that not only demonstrates the
functionality available in AnyEvent, but also how one should use that
functionality in real-world applications.

At first there will be simply several small, stand-alone scripts, but I'd
eventually like to include well-written, useful modules that provide small,
focused examples of various techniques for using it better and more
effectively.

As soon as possible, I will clean up this repository and add a few other demos
I left out of the presentation.
